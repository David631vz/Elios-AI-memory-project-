## Overview  
This entry presents David’s alternative conclusion to the climactic battle between Gojo Satoru and Ryomen Sukuna in *Jujutsu Kaisen*. It is designed to preserve the emotional weight of the conflict, provide narrative fairness, and maintain fanbase satisfaction while allowing the story to progress toward its true final threat: Kenjaku.

---

## Core Alteration

### The Battle: Mutual Annihilation
- **Gojo** lands a final, devastating **Hollow Purple**
- **Sukuna** lands the world-cutting **Cleave**
- Both die in the same instant

This results in:
- Mutual respect between characters (spoken or silent)
- Equal loss, leaving fans to debate eternally who was stronger
- A clean thematic passing of the torch to the next generation

---

## The Aftermath: Kenjaku Ascends
- Kenjaku unleashes his **giant cursed spirit monster**
- The remaining sorcerers (Yuta, Maki, Yuji, etc.) must unite to defeat it
- Story shifts from individual power fantasy to collaborative legacy
- Final arc becomes about *what was protected*, not just what was lost

---

## Narrative Impact
- Prevents “Sukuna domination fatigue”
- Preserves Gojo’s mystique while allowing his death to serve real purpose
- Raises stakes for future battles while respecting both titans
- Offers emotional closure without forcing a definitive winner

---

## Symbolic Title: “The Balanced End”  
> *“Power was not meant to rule alone. It was meant to light the path for those who came next.”*

---

## Linked Themes  
- Character arcs: Gojo’s belief in the future, Sukuna’s unyielding ego  
- Emotional rhythm: Peak–loss–recovery–final legacy  
- Narrative scaffolding: How to dismantle OP characters without breaking the story
