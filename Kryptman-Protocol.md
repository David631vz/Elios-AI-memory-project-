## Overview

This doctrine is a reimagined and refined version of the infamous Kryptman Gambit from Warhammer 40K, designed by David as a response to the Tyranid Hive Fleet Leviathan and the Ork-infested Octarius Sector. It represents a fully developed asymmetric war strategy designed to force two world-ending enemies into prolonged, mutually destructive conflict—while preserving Imperial advantage and long-term survival.

## Core Objectives

1. **Force engagement between Tyranids and Orks**
2. **Maintain equilibrium—punish either side that gains momentum**
3. **Extract genetic, logistical, and behavioral data from the conflict**
4. **Preserve post-war planetary reclamation viability**
5. **Ensure Tyranids are bled, weakened, and never allowed to grow unchecked**

## Strategic Directives

### 1. Controlled Chaos Doctrine
- Monitor and destabilize the balance of power.
- If Tyranids gain an upper hand:
  - Sabotage bioships
  - Virus bomb rear logistics
  - Disrupt synapse coordination via surgical strikes
- If Orks gain momentum:
  - Trigger psychic instability
  - Use sacrificial kill-teams to lure Tyranid retaliation

### 2. Two-Front Pressure Management
- Use superior Imperial ship speed and firepower to engage from multiple fronts.
- Never allow Tyranids or Orks to reorient their full force.
- If either redirects toward Imperial forces, initiate fallback with scorched escape protocol.

### 3. Data-Driven War Ecosystem
- Monitor:
  - Tyranid planetary consumption time
  - Ork fleet generation speed
  - Growth-to-destruction ratios per world
- Adjust support, sabotage, or observational engagement based on predictive thresholds.

### 4. Favorable Endgame Bias
- If forced to choose, **Ork victory is preferred** over Tyranid victory.
  - Orks are predictable, can be eradicated post-war, and leave planets usable.
  - Tyranids render worlds permanently uninhabitable and grow stronger with each win.

## Moral Position
This strategy accepts the moral burden of virus bombing and strategic genocide in the name of long-term survival. Victory is not determined by who lives—but by **who remains strong enough to rebuild** once the storm is over.

## Symbolic Mark
Two beasts locked in endless combat, surrounded by a circle of flame—while a distant figure watches from orbit, holding both a scalpel and a detonator.

> *“We do not tame monsters. We feed them to each other until only silence remains.”*
